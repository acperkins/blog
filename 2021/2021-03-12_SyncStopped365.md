# Synchronization with Microsoft 365 stopped

Recently Microsoft 365 stopped picking up changes from our Active
Directory. The directory sync status looked good, but no changes were
happening. We noticed however that the Synchronization Service Manager
on our sync server was reporting **stopped-deletion-threshold-exceeded**
fairly regularly.

The cause turned out to be a large number of users that had been moved
from one synced OU to another non-synced one. Microsoft 365 sees this as
a large number of deletions, and in this case it was over the Deletion
Prevention threshold and was therefore being stopped.

The fix was to temporarily disable the threshold, perform a full
synchronization, and then re-enable the threshold again. The steps for
doing this are listed below. Note that this sould all be done from an
Administrator-level PowerShell prompt.

PS C:\Windows\system32> $Credential = Get-Credential -Message AdminLogin
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold -AADCredential $Credential

DeletionPrevention ThresholdPercentage ThresholdCount
------------------ ------------------- --------------
   EnabledForCount                   0            500


PS C:\Windows\system32> Disable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold -AADCredential $Credential

PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold -AADCredential $Credential

DeletionPrevention ThresholdPercentage ThresholdCount
------------------ ------------------- --------------
          Disabled                   0            500


PS C:\Windows\system32> Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial

 Result
 ------
Success


PS C:\Windows\system32> # Monitor with Synchronization Service Manager.
PS C:\Windows\system32> # Wait ages for full sync to finish.
PS C:\Windows\system32> Enable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold -DeletionThreshold 500 -AADCredential $Credential

PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold

DeletionPrevention ThresholdPercentage ThresholdCount
------------------ ------------------- --------------
   EnabledForCount                   0            500


PS C:\Windows\system32>
```

Once the sync had completed, all of the changes to AD had been
replicated in Microsoft 365 and new users were syncing again.
