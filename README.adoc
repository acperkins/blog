I have decided to start keeping a blog for when I'm troubleshooting something. This will help me in
the future by giving me something that I can refer back to.

The canonical URL for this blog is https://code.acperkins.com/acp/blog and there is a mirror on
Github at https://github.com/acperkins/blog.

If you notice any mistakes please feel free to let me know, or submit a patch or a pull request.

Please see the file link:COPYRIGHT.adoc[COPYRIGHT.adoc] for copyright and usage terms.
